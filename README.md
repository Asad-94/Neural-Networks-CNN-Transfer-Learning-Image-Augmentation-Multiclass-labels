# Neural-Networks-CNN-Transfer-Learning-Image-Augmentation-Multiclass-labels
A repository that shows how to create a basic neural network using TensorFlow,  along with the implementation of Convolutional Neural Network, Transfer learning, Image augmentation and Multiclass labels concepts in Tensorflow.

It uses multiple datasets for classification such as Humans & Horses, Cats & Dogs, and Rock, Paper Scissors.
